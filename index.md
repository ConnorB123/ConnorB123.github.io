## Welcome to Connor Blauch's CS 499 Capstone Portfolio

## Introduction
This is my final year in the computer science program. I am currently focusing on Cyber Security and I am working
in the field right now. I have honestly enjoyed my time taking these online classes. However though sometimes I feel like I missed
out on going to college in person. But with how things have turned out the last year or so. I am pretty happy with my decision now. Cyber Security
was one of the few things from high school I actually enjoyed learning about. I remember watching a video in a computer class about Cyber Security 
pen testing. This when I realized what I wanted to do and have not looked back since.

## Summary
When I first started this class I was pretty nervous because I felt like I was going to struggle with some of the aspects because its
been a while since I ahve dont some of the concepts. But after going through I was surpised to realize how much I still rememeber what 
I need to do. I really enjoyed doing this entire project and that honestly was a suprise also to me because when I first looked through I 
thought this doesnt look to much fun.

## Self-Assessment 
Overall, I would like to think I have a good understanding of Computer Science and what is expected of me from working through each aspect of it. 
I feel like completing this project did a couple things for me. At first it was the perfect way to go back through all my old work and remember how I did everything. 
This helped greatly because it allowed for me to feel more confident with the final product. After I am getting through all my old stuff, 
I feel like this project really allowed for me to express what I have learned throughout my course because it allowed for the use of a 
bunch of different technique and source of technology to be used. One big thing is using GitHub, I have used this program a bunch in the 
past for other work outside of school. But my first really run in with a program like this was Bitbucket for a class. After that 
I was easily able to understand GitHub and how it worked.  I think for me though t the hardest thing is commenting each commitment I make. 
Having a portfolio has made me also realize how important it is to keep one up to date. If you have a resume this can also show people who run the 
company that you know what you are doing. The targeted sections for this capstone turned out to be a lot of fun. The fact that I got to create my 
own type of software was a lot of fun. Then working through data structures and databases brought up a bunch of questions I had from previous 
classes and allowed for me to leave this class feel even more comfortable. This portfolio shows a wide variety of my skills because it has a 
bunch of different aspects to it. Like talked about previous it shows that I understand how to use GitHub and what to do with it. Also, 
it shows just a few areas in computer science that I am comfortable with but they are opposites that it allows for a good luck into what 
I have completed throughout my time in college.
