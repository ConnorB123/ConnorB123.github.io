## Welcome to Connor Blauch's CS 499 Capstone Portfolio

## Introduction
This is my final year in the computer science program. I am currently focusing on Cyber Security and I am working
in the field right now. I have honestly enjoyed my time taking these online classes. However though sometimes I feel like I missed
out on going to college in person. But with how things have turned out the last year or so. I am pretty happy with my decision now.

## Summary
When I first started this class I was pretty nervous because I felt like I was going to struggle with some of the aspects because its
been a while since I ahve dont some of the concepts. But after going through I was surpised to realize how much I still rememeber what 
I need to do.
